// Exercise 1: The Sum of an Array
// The Array Object in JavaScript has a built-in reduce method that iterates over each value in an array and returns a value. It is very useful when calculating sums.
// Write a function that takes an array of numbers as a parameter and returns the sum value of each number in the array. (i.e. write a custom Array.prototype.reduce() function)
// You can use the follow array: const numbers = [2, 22, 12, 17, 18, 39, 129];
// Declare a function arraySum that takes numbers as a parameter
// Declare a variable sum and initialize sum as 0
// Inside the arraySum function body, iterate over each number (value) in the numbers array using the array's forEach method
// The array forEach method takes a callback (function) as a parameter, where you can pass in the value and index of the current array position
// numbers.forEach((number, index) => {...});
// Inside the body of the forEach callback function, write code so that each number in the numbers array is added to the value of sum
// Below the forEach method, then return sum;
// Call the arraySum(numbers) method inside console.log to print out the returned sum.

const numbers = [2, 22, 12, 17, 18, 39, 129];


// function totalArray(arr) {

// }

function arraySum(numbers) {
  let sum = 0;
  numbers.forEach(function (value) {
    sum += value;
  });
  return sum;
}

console.log(arraySum(numbers));

// Exercise 2: Favorite Book
// Write a “Book” object. Your book object should have the book’s title, author, the number of pages, and whether or not you have read the book
// Declare a variable named book, and assign an object ({}) to the variable.
// Using dot notation:
// assign the title of your favorite book to a property named title,
// assign the number of pages to a property named pages,
// and assign the number of times you've read the book to a property named readCount
// Using dot notation, add a method named info to the book object that returns a string that combines the title, pages, and readCount as an informational string. Ex: The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien, 295 pages, read 3 times.
// After you have added the properties and method to the object, call the book.info() method inside console.log to print out the returned string.

const book = {};

book.title = 'Awesome Book';
book.pages = 500;
book.readCount = 2;

book.info = function () {
  return `${this.title}, ${this.pages} pages, read ${this.readCount} times.`;
};

console.log(book.info());
